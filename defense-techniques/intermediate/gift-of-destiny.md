1. Left palmheel to back of attacker's right hand
1. Grasp attacker's hand
1. Step forward, inward elbow to attacker's jaw
1. Loop elbow back out, down, under attacker's arm, then up so that your arm is behind theirs.
1. Pivot left hand grasp so that thumb is on the back of the attacker's hand.
1. Step back with right foot, bringing attacker's hand down to right.
_Attacker should be bent over at this point_
1. Rear (right) leg front snap instep kick to attacker's face.

_Use Marriage of Gravity. Since attacker's wrist should already be flexed as much as possible to get the wrist lock, the intent is to break their wrist._
