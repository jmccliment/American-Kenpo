# Chinese Maces

## Purpose
The purpose of my kata is to practice two defense techinques with complex, coordinated motions - **Chinese Pincers** and **Shield and Mace** - on both the right and left side.

## Reason
In American Kenpo, defense techniques are not intended to be used by rote in real-world scenarios; rather, they are intended to help build muscle memory, awareness of target areas, and demonstrate changes to height, width, and depth. These techniques both have coordinated motions, with the right and left hands executing simultaneous moves, some with stance transitions as well. Practicing these techniques on both sides will help build that muscle memory and coordination.
